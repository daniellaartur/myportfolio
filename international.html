          <!--Introduction to the project-->
          <h3 class="heading-project">Introduction</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The <i>International Week School Project</i> was a semester course
            event that brought together students from different countries in a
            full immersive experience. Through nine diverse groups, we worked
            under pressure to build interactive and impactful concepts,
            harnessing our cultural exchange and collaboration to create
            innovative solutions. This project challenged us to think outside
            the box, develop essential skills, and foster cross-cultural
            understanding, culminating in a transformative journey of personal
            growth and international cooperation.
          </p>

          <!--Overview of the problem-->

          <h3 class="heading-project">Understanding the problem</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Proudly and happily collaborating with Vestide and Woonbedrijf, our
            project aimed to develop an interactive tool to support the students
            of the LOT community, a community created by Vestide to enable
            students to voice themselves.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Goal:</b> to create an innovative platform that would incentivize
            students to share their ideas and perspectives on the design and
            development of a new student residence at the university campus. By
            harnessing the power of technology, architecture and design we aimed
            to foster a sense of community engagement, allowing students to
            actively contribute to shaping their living environment.
          </p>

            alt="Collaborative work"
          />
          <p class="paragraph">
            Working in a multicultural and multidisciplinary team comprised of
            students from Germany, Bulgaria, Mozambique, France, The Netherlands
            and Armenia our project followed a dynamic workflow. We kicked off
            with intense collective brainstorming sessions, leveraging our
            diverse backgrounds in media design, landscape design, and
            architecture. As the project progressed, tasks were distributed
            among team members. I had the honor of focusing on
            <u>designing the user interface for the interactive tool,</u>
            ensuring an intuitive and engaging user experience. Additionally, I
            contributed to the project by
            <u>creating the tool's logo,</u> adding a visual identity that
            captured the essence of our collaborative effort.
          </p>

          <!--Quick concept explanation-->

          <h3 class="subheading-project">Concept</h3>
          <p class="paragraph concept">
            A space where students are allowed to speak up their minds to
            strengthen their community values while visualizing the contribution
            of their input on a bigger scale.
          </p>

          <!--Explaining the logo section-->
          <h3 class="subheading-project">The logo</h3>
          <img
            class="cover-image"
            src="/images/plot-logo.png"
            alt="Collaborative work"
          />
          <p class="paragraph">
            The logo I designed for the interactive tool called
            <i>Plot</i> embodies a minimalist style that captures its essence
            flawlessly. The name "Plot" not only represents the tool itself but
            also highlights the significance of the LOT communityâ€”a vibrant
            community of students. The logo features a
            <u>clean and sleek design,</u> symbolizing the simplicity and
            efficiency of the tool. With its elegant and understated aesthetic,
            the Plot logo serves as a visual representation of the collaborative
            spirit and the sense of belonging within the LOT community.
          </p>

          <!--Input screen Figme file section-->
          <h3 class="subheading-project">Input Screen</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The loop video attached showcases the user flow of the Plot tool,
            allowing students to input their ideas. The video starts with a view
            displaying four quadrant buttons, representing the values of the LOT
            community. When a user clicks in one of the buttons to contribute
            their ideas, they are directed to a message field where they can
            leave their input. Finally, the video concludes with a confirmation
            and appreciation pop-up screen, where users have the option to
            provide their email if they wish to receive updates on the idea they
            shared. If you want to fully experience the prototype and navigate
            through the user flow, don't forget to check out the accompanying

          <h3 class="heading-project">Reflections</h3>
          <p class="paragraph" style="padding-bottom: 0">
            The Dutch Design Charette was profound experience that left a
            lasting impact on me. Engaging with individuals from diverse
            nationalities not only broadened my horizons but also deepened my
            understanding of collaborative work. Through this immersive journey,
            I witnessed the power of effective communication and learned
            valuable lessons in teamwork. The experience itself was mesmerizing,
            but winning the charette was the icing on the cake, pleasantly
            surprising me and validating our hard work.
