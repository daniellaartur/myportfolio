        <!--Introduction to the project-->
        <h3 class="heading-project" style="font-weight: 800">Context</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Imagine the last time you got a sample at a perfume store or even a
          try- out cut cheese at your local market. All of these are slightly
          familiar to a lot of us and usually bring great memories of the few
          times we get to have something “for free” in this expensive world.
          Whether the goal is to raise brand awareness, persuade people to
          purchase, or simply be kind to strangers, many companies have seen a
          huge impact and benefit in giving proof of how their products work
          without saying a lot about it. Instead, having people build their own
          opinion. <br />
          During my internship at InProcess-LSP, I was challenged to come up
          with a website that will be used as a demo to people interested in the
          NFS <i> (NanoFlowSizer). </i>
        </p>

        <!--The problem -->

        <h3 class="heading-project">What's the problem?</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The NanoFlowSizer is a device that is used to measure the size of
          small particles, impacting different industries. Customers of this
          product are located all over the world, limiting its promotion to
          mainly events and conferences they participate. Which, obviously,
          hinders potential customers from fully grasping the product's
          capabilities and value.

          “How might we demonstrate the functionalities of the NFS on a web

        </p>

        <!--Explaining the approach used-->
        <h3 class="heading-project" style="font-weight: 600">Approach used</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Early on my internship, I knew the goal of the project- to build a
          website hosting a demo of the NFS. However, the <i>“know-how”</i> was
          still lacking. Thereafter, using the Design Thinking Approach I was
          able to not only prioritize human-centred design but also focus on
          problem-solving.
        </p>

            Talking with people...
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Backed up by the question:
            <i
              >“What is the NFS and what are the key features the product
              offers?”</i
            >
            I focused in building empathy towards users. <br />
            The main objective was not necessarily answering the question
            initially prompted but, expanding my perspective and setting aside
            any assumptions I initially had. <br />Through conducting
            interviews, reading documents, and observation sessions, I was able
            to collect insightful data (such as user needs, current customer
            journey, expectations and more) and fully put myself in the user's
            shoes by not only hearing what they say but also
            <u>attempting to uncover what remained unsaid.</u>
          </p>
        </div>

        <!--What was retrieved from interviews/survey-->
        <h4 class="sub-heading">What did people say?</h4>

        <p class="paragraph">The results of this phase can be summarized as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>User need:</b> Facilitated environment to understand the workings
            of the NFS
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Expectations: </b>Flexible set-up to customers to increase their
            perception of the system by providing a simpler/self-explanatory
            tool for try-out.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!--Results-->
        <h3 class="heading-project" style="font-weight: 600">And now?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          From the research conducted, I understood that the design of my
          producted needed to be simple and include the main interactions the
          actual device has to offer. Thus, providing the customer with an
          initial perception of the NFS without overwhelming them with complex
          features. <br />
          To best visualize this, I made an Information Architecture scheme,
          structurizing an ideal user flow for the product to be designed.

        <!--Conclusion part-->
        <h3 class="heading-project" style="font-weight: 600">To conclude...</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The purpose of this internship was to create a web interface for the
          current NFS, sold at InProcess-LSP. Through research and analysis
          conveyed I was able to understand what makes a demo appealing to
          people- mainly the fact that they get the proof a certain product
          works. <br />
          Followed by a high-fidelity design implementation I concluded the
          relevance of creating interactive products that increase the user
          experience, by facilitating the way they will navigate my website-
          ensuring clear communication, and comprehensive and intuitive UI. This
          project will serve as the foundation for further web development on
          the basis of creating a great environment to be used in marketing,
          product demos, and more.
