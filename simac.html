              I am pleased with the project and believe the six ladies did a
              commendable job. This was likely one of the most difficult task of
              the semester due its scope. They came up with an idea that seems
              plausible to work in the current situation...

          <p class="paragraph">
            During the current school semester, I collaborated with five other
            strong-minded women to improve SIMAC NL's onboarding process for
            international professionals coming to the Netherlands for work.
            <br />
            <uv>Our mission</uv> was to create a comprehensive onboarding
            program tailored to the unique needs of international hires. Through
            extensive research collaboration with SIMAC, and continuosly
            iterations, we developed an innovative product that not only
            addressed practical aspects but also emphasized cultural differences
            and encouraged new hires to step out of their comfort zone in a fun
            and engaging environment, challenging individuals to build
            relationships with their fellow coworkers.

          <p class="paragraph">
            Our approach to the semester project was initially met with a sense
            of apprehension due to its vague nature. However, through the
            guidance and invaluable tips provided by our teachers, we quickly
            learned the

            As a team, we opted to leverage the power of <u>Monday.com,</u> a
            collaborative platform that facilitated task division and ensured
            fair assignment of work among us. One key takeaway from the planning
            stage was

            fostering clear and effective communication among all parties

              impact of the onboarding process on employee retention rates,
            </a>
            seeking to understand the underlying factors that contribute to
            long-term commitment within a company. Surprisingly, the results
            revealed a strong correlation between effective onboarding and
            employees' decision to stay or leave
            <u>within the first six months of employment.</u> This finding
            highlighted the critical importance of a well-executed onboarding
            process. <br />
            <br />Additionally,
            <a

              I conducted an analysis of SIMAC's platforms,</a
            >
            particularly their LinkedIn profile and website. The <b>aim</b>
            was to uncover common words and phrases utilized by SIMAC in their
            social media and online presence. This analysis not only provided
            valuable insights into their content strategy but also served as a
            lens to understand how they engage with individuals who may be
            unfamiliar with the company.
          </p>

          <!--Interviews-->
          <h4 class="sub-heading">Interviews</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">
            During a recent series of interviews conducted, we sought to gain
            insight into how employees perceive their onboarding experiences and
            the subsequent impact on their work. The interviews were organized
            in pairs, resulting in a total of
            <b>six engaging discussions.</b> Three interviewees were from
            various Dutch companies, while the remaining three were from Simac.
            Among the interviews I conducted, one particularly stood out. At
            Simac, my goal was to
            <u
              >understand the employee's perspective on the onboarding process
              within the company.</u
            >
            Surprisingly, the language barrier, which I initially presumed to be
            a significant challenge, was not an issue. The interviewee revealed
            that the company effortlessly switches to English when needed. In
            contrast, another interview left a lasting impression, even though I
            didn't personally conduct or analyze it. Denisy Cuna, the
            interviewee, emphasized the importance of socializing with
            colleagues outside of the workplace. According to her, this practice
            benefits both the company and employees, as it facilitates
            discussions about work in informal settings, enhances communication
            skills, and fosters meaningful connections among co-workers.

            the most prominent categories. As a result, we decided to follow the

            considering the consistent relevance and emphasis the interviewees

          <h4 class="sub-heading">Initial concept</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Our first concept aimed to foster a deeper understanding of cultural
            differences within the company, while simultaneously encouraging
            employees to develop lasting relationships with the organization.
            The idea was to create an environment that promotes awareness and
            appreciation of diverse cultures, enabling employees to gain
            valuable insights into different perspectives. Additionally, we
            envisioned providing guidance and support to employees in achieving
            their personal and professional goals, emphasizing the company's
            commitment to their growth and development. By combining cultural
            awareness and individual support, our concept aimed to enhance
            employee engagement and create a strong sense of belonging within
            the organization.

            A platform where new hires enhance their cultural differences

            alt="PDP sketches"
          />
          <p class="paragraph">
            In my sketches, I focused on designing a
            <u>personal development plan</u> as part of the concept mentioned
            earlier. The idea was
            <b
              >to provide employees with a platform where they could outline
              their goals and aspirations, and receive feedback</b
            >
            from their managers on their progress and areas for improvement.
            <br />
            However, after gathering feedback from stakeholders, this particular
            aspect of the concept was discarded. The stakeholders expressed some
            concerns about how the personal development plan seemed to veer more
            towards HR matters rather than being directly related to onboarding.
            Although initially disappointing, I saw this feedback as an
            opportunity for growth. It allowed me to build upon the criticism
            and develop a more creative and straightforward approach, which will
            be explored in the upcoming sections.

          <h4 class="sub-heading">Concept iteration</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Following the feedback from stakeholders, our project underwent a
            series of rapid iterations. Adopting a "pressure-cooker" approach,
            our group came together and, amidst the time constraints, critically
            assessed our previous research and brainstorming findings. It became
            evident that in order to truly emphasize socialization, which we
            recognized as the primary hook, we needed to place it at the heart
            of the concept. This led us to shift our focus from the initial
            individual-centric app to a more socially interactive platform.
            Through this process, we discovered that the concept that defines
            the entire project is fostering meaningful connections and fostering
            a sense of community within the organization.

            A challenge-based app for new employees, fostering interaction and
            collaboration. It includes a world map highlighting cultural
            diversity within the company. The aim is to create an engaging and
            inclusive work environment.

            I was assigned to design the world map view as the homepage of the
            app. Opting for a minimalistic style, I incorporated smooth
            animations on the screen. The pin points on the map dynamically
            change as users scroll through the bottom cards. When reaching a
            specific card, a pop-up notification appears, presenting users with
            an intriguing daily challenge they are encouraged to follow.

            I conducted a concept validation testing session with Jenny Doan to
            assess the user understanding of the prototype design. The testing
            was divided into
            <u>two sections: task-based assessment and usability evaluation.</u>
            The former aimed to guide the tester in completing specific prompts,
            while the latter focused on the clarity of the app and the tester's
            experience while using it. <br />Key takeaways from the testing
            included Jenny rating the ease of navigating the product as
            <b>9 out of 10,</b> a suggestion to incorporate click functionality
            in addition to scrolling on the map view, a desire for more engaging
            animations such as winning a trophy and spinning the wheel, and a
            strong endorsement from Jenny, stating she would definitely
            recommend the app to others.

            Looking back & Forward
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Initially, the vagueness of the project was intimidating, but with
            guidance and support, I gained the confidence to explore different
            avenues. It has completely shifted my approach to tasks, encouraging
            a more hands-on mentality rather than getting lost in refining
            minute details endlessly. <br />Recognizing the limitations of the
            topic and time constraints played a crucial role in enabling me to
            contribute proactively. Throughout the process, I realized the
            importance of action and building tangible elements rather than
            getting lost in excessive research and discussion. While I invested
            significant effort, I acknowledge that there is always room for
            improvement. <br /><br />
            In the future, I aim to strike a balance between research and taking
            action, focusing on creating small elements that bring the vision to
            life. The satisfaction I feel is immense, as I not only delivered
            powerful research that may benefit future students but also created
            visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. My heart is filled
            with joy and pride as we work together to
