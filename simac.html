          <p class="paragraph">
            During the current school semester, I collaborated with five other
            strong-minded women to improve SIMAC NL's onboarding process for
            international professionals coming to the Netherlands for work.
            <br />
            <uv>Our mission</uv> was to create a comprehensive onboarding
            program tailored to the unique needs of international hires. Through
            extensive research collaboration with SIMAC, and continuosly
            iterations, we developed an innovative product that not only
            addressed practical aspects but also emphasized cultural differences
            and encouraged new hires to step out of their comfort zone in a fun
            and engaging environment, challenging individuals to build
            relationships with their fellow coworkers.

          <p class="paragraph">
            Our approach to the semester project was initially met with a sense
            of apprehension due to its vague nature. However, through the
            guidance and invaluable tips provided by our teachers, we quickly
            learned the
            <i
              >importance of breaking things down and seeking a starting
              point.</i

            As a team, we opted to leverage the power of <u>Monday.com,</u> a
            collaborative platform that facilitated task division and ensured
            fair assignment of work among us. One key takeaway from the planning
            stage was
            <b
              >the initiative I took to be the contact person with
              stakeholders,</b
            >
            fostering clear and effective communication among all parties
            involved. Together, we meticulously crafted a comprehensive project
            plan that served as our guiding beacon throughout the duration of
            the project. To view our detailed project plan, kindly click on

          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: -1.5rem">
            The question above suggests that the current enviornment at SIMAC is
            rather exclusive, without huge variety in employee nationalities.
            The <u>aim</u> in the formulated collocation was to accept and
            embrance the broadness of the problem assigned while tailoring our
            research to a specific target group,
            <i>international professionals.</i>

            The primary empathize stage of the project focused on gaining a
            profound understanding of the problem and the users' needs. To
            achieve this, comprehensive research was conducted. That included
            literature research, interviews and data analysis, in order to
            gather insights and empathize with the experiences of international
            professionals and their onboarding challenges at SIMAC NL.

            During the empathize stage of the project, I undertook a
            comprehensive literature research, focusing on two key areas
            assigned to me based on the group's agreed task division. Firstly, I

              impact of the onboarding process on employee retention rates,
            </a>
            seeking to understand the underlying factors that contribute to
            long-term commitment within a company. Surprisingly, the results
            revealed a strong correlation between effective onboarding and
            employees' decision to stay or leave
            <u>within the first six months of employment.</u> This finding
            highlighted the critical importance of a well-executed onboarding
            process. <br />

              I conducted an analysis of SIMAC's platforms,</a
            >
            particularly their LinkedIn profile and website. The <b>aim</b>
            was to uncover common words and phrases utilized by SIMAC in their
            social media and online presence. This analysis not only provided
            valuable insights into their content strategy but also served as a
            lens to understand how they engage with individuals who may be
            unfamiliar with the company.
