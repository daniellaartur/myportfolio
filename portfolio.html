                >, I focused on the <u>field research</u>
                by exploring what was already done, not only by other
                professionals, but primarily by previous students, who have also
                built a portfolio as part of their semester assignment.

              />
              <p class="paragraph">
                After much contemplation, I made the decision to utilize
                <i>Squarespace</i> as the platform for building my portfolio,
                stepping away from the initial notion of coding it myself. This
                shift allowed me to streamline the development process and focus
                on presenting my work effectively. The resulting portfolio
                exudes a minimalist and simple aesthetic, aligning with my
                design principles. Choosing Squarespace was primarily driven by
                time considerations, recognizing that coding it from scratch
                within the given time limitations would be <b>challenging</b>.
                By leveraging the user-friendly features and templates offered
                by Squarespace, I was able to create a visually appealing and
                professional portfolio that effectively showcases my skills and
                projects.

              <h3 class="heading-project">To coding it myself!</h3>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Despite being initially frightned and worried about developing
                the portfolio myself,I made a pivotal decision to
                <u
                  >transition from Squarespace and code my portfolio myself.
                </u>
                This shift was not an easy one, as I initially had concerns
                about the time and complexity involved. However, I recognized
                that by coding it myself, I would have complete control over the
                design and functionality, allowing me to truly leverage my
                coding abilities.

              <p class="paragraph">
                For the construction of this portfolio, I relied on the
                fundamental building blocks of web development:
                <u>HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.</u> Having a basic
                understanding of these technologies, I found them to be
                perfectly suited for the task at hand. Given the simplicity of
                the portfolio's design, I was able to achieve impressive results
                by leveraging the core functionalities of these languages. This
                approach allowed me to maintain full control over the code and
                tailor it precisely to my needs. Harnessing the power of HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted a polished and functional
                portfolio that effectively showcases my work and
                capabilities.<br />

              <p class="paragraph">
                During the transition to coding my portfolio myself, I took the
                opportunity for a complete rebranding, shifting from the
                previous dark-themed design to a lighter and more refreshing
                version. However, I made sure to maintain the minimal and
                elegant style that truly reflects my personality. The design
                choices I made were not solely based on personal taste, but also
                rooted in extensive research focused on easy navigation,
                effective content structure, and user-friendliness. By opting
                for a lighter color palette, I aimed to create a visually
                pleasing and inviting experience for visitors. The use of clean
                lines and ample white space enhances readability and highlights
                the key elements of my portfolio. The minimalist approach allows
                the focus to remain on the content itself, ensuring that my work
                takes center stage

                willing to try different approaches and make adjustments along
                the way. As I delved into the world of coding, I encountered
                moments of frustration and uncertainty. However, each obstacle
                became an opportunity for growth and expansion of my coding
                skills. It was <b>through trial and error,</b> countless hours
                of research, and seeking guidance from online resources that I
                gradually transformed my vision into a <b>tangible website.</b>
