        <p class="paragraph">
          In a dynamic collaboration between Team Liquid, a leading esports
          organization, and Fontys University of Applied Sciences, a unique
          challenge was presented to second-year students. <br /><b
            >The mission?</b
          >
          To conceptualize and develop a cutting-edge loyalty program product,
          inspired by the success of Team Liquid's own offering, Liquid+. This
          presented an exciting opportunity to dive into the intricacies of a
          real-world business and devise a customized loyalty program tailored
          to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.
        </p>

        <!--The problem -->

        <h3 class="heading-project">What's the problem?</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          In the realm of nightlife, a persistent challenge shadows the vibrant
          atmosphere of clubs and social gatherings. Whether accompanied by
          friends, family, or partners, people frequently encounter the
          exhausting process of ordering beverages. Long queues become a
          bottleneck, demanding time and energy that could be better spent
          enjoying the vibrant atmosphere.The struggle as the necessity to keep
          an eye on companions in the crowd adds an additional layer of stress.
          The fear of losing sight of friends or loved ones diminishes the
          overall enjoyment of the night out. As the night concludes, a new set
          of concerns emerges. The safety of the journey home becomes a
          paramount consideration. Navigating transportation options and
          ensuring a secure return often lingers in the minds of patrons,
          disrupting the seamless transition from a night of celebration to the
          comfort of home.

        <!--Explaining the approach used-->
        <h3 class="heading-project" style="font-weight: 600">Approach used</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The journey to revolutionize the nightlife experience unfolded through
          a careful and innovative application of the
          <u>Design Thinking approach.</u><br />
          Rooted in empathy, creativity, and user-centricity, this methodology
          guided every step of our process. By embracing the principles of the
          chosem approach, our work process ensured a holistic, user-focused
          approach that aligned with the dynamic and complex nature of the
          nightlife environment. This methodology empowered us to not only
          address the identified challenges but to innovate and elevate the
          overall club experience

          Talking with people...
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          To understand the intricacies of the nightlife experience, we
          conducted a comprehensive empathize phase using a dual-method
          approach:
          <u>qualitative (interviews) and quantitative research(survey).</u>
          My involvement in this stage was mainly in crafting survey questions,
          conducting interviews, and analyzing both quantitative and qualitative
          data. This hands-on involvement ensured a thorough understanding of
          the user experience.

          How long do they wait at the bar to get a drink?

        <!--Results-->
        <h3 class="heading-project" style="font-weight: 600">And now?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          From the preliminary studies, we understood that the main problems
          people encounter when going out to a nightclube included: <br />
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Long waiting time at the bar</li>
          <li>Lack of transportation back home</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Based on the aspects above as well as the client task of creating a
          loyalty program, ShelterUp came to life. A loyalty program designed to
          take anyone's clubbing experience to the next level, enhancing an
          appealing reward system and facilitating challenges people encounter
          at nightclubs.

        <!--Conclusion part-->
        <h3 class="heading-project" style="font-weight: 600">To conclude...</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          This designed loyalty program app is not just a product; it's a result
          of extensive research that identified pain points of beverage
          ordering, social cohesion, and safety concerns. <br />
          By streamlining processes and fostering a user-centric approach, it
          brough a new concept to the table. While I am extremely happy with the
          results, I must say that the end-product can still benefit from
          improvements, mainly on aspects regarding the rewards offering and
          transportation options in the application.
